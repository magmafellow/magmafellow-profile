  <h2>Preview web app on mobile</h2>
  <p>
    Previewing web app on mobile is very convinient way to moderate your markup
    on mobile-screen sizes of viewport. It is really it
  </p>
  <h3>Nextjs with it</h3>
  <p>
    When you run <span class="command">npm run dev</span> you are prompted to go
    to <span class="link">http://localhost:3000</span>, but it would be great if
    also you were prompted something like
    <span class="link">http://199.0.0.256:3000</span>. Sadly it is not like that.
  </p>
  <h3>Checking your own numbers</h3>
  <p>The solution is in fact that you can find them, these numbers!</p>
  <ol class="instructions">
    <li>get to terminal</li>
    <li>enter there <span class="command">ifconfig</span></li>
    <li>find your IP-4 like internet address (something like 199.0.0.256)</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="warning">
    <span class="bold highlight">ifconfig</span> might differ on different OS. This command is valid for Linus/Mac OS
  </div>
  <p>So with that in bag we can go next.</p>
  <p>Put this address into <span class="highlight">http://[address]:3000</span>. That is it!</p>
  <h2>Congrats! ðŸŽ‰</h2>
